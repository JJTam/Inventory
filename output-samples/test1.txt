Wow, so happy to work on a programming assignment again! Yes Yes YES! Let's play with inventories this time! ^_____^

Let's do some tests on the Item class first.
I have 3 cookies!
Give me 2 more!
Now I have 5 cookies!
Take 4 away from me... result=true
Now I have 1 cookie left... T_T
Try to take 4 more away from me... result=false
Now I have 1 cookie left... T_T
===============================
OK, now we really play with the inventories!
Empty inventory:
